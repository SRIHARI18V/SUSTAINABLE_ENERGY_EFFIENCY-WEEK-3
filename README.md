🌱 AI-Powered Smart Microgrid Energy Forecasting System
📌 Overview

This project develops an AI-driven forecasting and optimization system for smart microgrids. Using LSTM-based deep learning models, it predicts energy demand and renewable generation patterns, enabling intelligent load balancing, cost optimization, and enhanced grid stability.

The system is built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, and Docker, and integrates renewable energy and weather data for real-world applicability.
